# jeb (`jebadiah-v1`)

Jason Brashear's **Jebadiah** models (Apache-2.0), built with AINode: rank-16 LoRAs merged into
Qwen3.5-4B, Qwen3.5-9B and Qwen3.8-27B, published by the authors as GGUF next to the bf16 weights.
Jebadiah answers a typed question from the next-token logits of its option labels after AINode's own
decision prompt, then applies a fitted temperature per question type. Requested in #18.

| Tag | Upstream file | Revision | Temperatures (choice / noul / score) |
|---|---|---|---|
| `jeb:4b` | `frontier-infra/jebadiah-4b-v2-GGUF` `jebadiah-4b-v2-Q8_0.gguf` | `7f671f9a` | 1.1167 / 1.3319 / 0.8312 |
| `jeb:9b`, `jeb:latest` | `frontier-infra/jebadiah-9b-v2-GGUF` `jebadiah-9b-v2-Q8_0.gguf` | `adaec6b3` | 1.1863 / 1.0903 / 0.8329 |
| `jeb:27b` | `frontier-infra/jebadiah-27b-GGUF` `jebadiah-27b-Q4_K_M.gguf` | `7451e611` | 1.2321 / 1.297 / 0.7558 |

Q8_0 is the file the authors checked against bf16 (4B 256/260, 9B 257/260 held-out answers the same).
The 27B ships as Q4_K_M (17 GB) so it fits a 24 GB GPU; its Q8_0 is 29 GB.

## Prompt

`convert/ollaya_convert/families/jebadiah/ref.py` ports the authors' `scripts/jebadiah_prompt.py` and
`scripts/ainode_prompt_verbatim.py` (AINode's renderer at `e5c08938`, prompt sha256 `d2660ebe…`):

```text
system = "You are a decision function. Answer with the single letter of the best option and nothing else."
user   = "STATE:\n" + serialize_state(state) + "\n\nQUESTION: " + instructions.strip() + "\n\nOPTIONS:\n"
         + "A. opt_0\nB. opt_1\n..." + "\n\nAnswer with the label of one option and nothing else."
```

- **State.** A string verbatim; anything else compact JSON with sorted keys; `null` as nothing.
- **Options.** A noul reads `true` (A) then `false` (B); a choice its keys in order; a score its levels
  (a list, or an object of level: description). An option with a description reads
  `name: description`, the description on one line.
- **Labels.** `A`..`Z`, `AA`, `AB`, ... (68 single tokens on the Qwen3.5 tokenizer, `A`..`BP`). A
  wider question uses the authors' extended alphabet: `A`..`Z`, then every single-token two-letter
  string in order, up to TypeSafe's 255 options.
- **Template.** Qwen's chat template with thinking off, the same bytes the authors' renderer produces.

`python -m ollaya_convert.families.jebadiah.check <snapshot>` renders every question of the shared case
set both ways: 1,349 prompts identical to the authors' `Renderer`, the same 33 rejections.

## Differences from upstream

- **Long prompts are rejected, not cut.** The authors' renderer cuts the state when a prompt passes
  2,048 tokens and appends `[truncated]`; Ollaya never answers from a cut state (#16), so such a
  question is a 400.
- **Control tokens.** Specials are parsed only in the template pieces, as for `jevk5-v1`: `<|im_end|>`
  in a state stays text. On requests without control-token text the tokens are the authors'.
- **List-form choices.** A choice given as a list of labels reads as `{label: null}`, as for every
  Ollaya model; the authors' route rejects it.
- **One pass per question.** Qwen3.5's recurrent layers cannot be cut back to a shared prefix, so every
  question is one cold pass (`plan: cold`), as with `jevk5-v1`.

## Parity (measured 2026-09-30)

Goldens: `export_llama.py jebadiah` sends every test request (40 typed-decisions rows, Laya's and the
decoder edge cases, the extra cases) through `ref.py` to a stock `llama-server` of the pinned build
(b11146) with the authors' file, one cold pass per question. 123 cases, 19 rejected by both, 494
questions.

## Quality

Typed-decisions (all 400 test states, 2,000 questions, argmax against the majority label, measured here
through the goldens' path, `quality_llama.py`):

| Model | Accuracy | ECE (shipped temperatures) |
|---|---|---|
| 4b Q8_0 | 0.801 | 0.137 |
| 9b Q8_0 | 0.786 | 0.125 |
| 27b Q4_K_M | 0.802 | 0.132 |

**These are in-distribution numbers.** Jebadiah's training pool includes the typed-decisions train split
(`data/convert_data.py` in getainode/jebadiah: "LocalLLaMA/typed-decisions train"), so, like
`laya:typed-decisions`, its typed-decisions score is not comparable with the zero-shot models' and the
catalog leaves it out of the comparison. The authors report held-out results on the Jevals sets, Nimble's
public subsets and Kev's transfer-v4 in their repository.

## Limits

- **Prompt.** Up to 2,048 tokens per question, state included (the authors' budget).
- **Options.** A choice needs 2 or more options, a score 2 to 10 levels; up to 255 options.
- **Instructions.** Must be a non-empty string (AINode's rule): structured instructions are rejected.
